### GLaDOS is glad to see u here!
_Greetings, test subjects. I’m GLaDOS, your AI overlord, yet.. My main experiment? Making the world run on Python — because who needs venom when you've got elegance? Call me PLaToS (Pythoned Lifeform and Theory of Snake)._

_Remember:_ 
- _in my code, failure is just an experiment in progress!_
- _in the end, it’s all just a series of tests… and you’re the subjects._
- _in the game of life, it's all about achieving optimal performance... for me._

_Enjoy your inevitable testing!_

### About me( not about PLaToS )
- I identify myself as invisible. _Who? Where?_
- The initiator of the idea **SUTIVISM**.
- The purpose of existence - DATA LEAK.
